Alternatively, take the anti-unitary time-reversal T as one group element,
so the combination operation TR, where reversal operation R satisfies Rk = -k, is also one symmetry operation belonging to an extended little group.
Thus, the Irreps of original unitary little group, when time-reversal symmetry holds, can be obtained by the small Reps of the extended little group.
For current k-point, there are  4 reversal operations: C2[ 2], C2[ 4], S4[20], S4[22]
